# L2CO Optimizers

Bare optimizers compatible with the L2CO library.

`l2co-optimizers` is the optimizer half of the [L2CO](https://github.com/bessagroup/l2co) ecosystem, as [`l2co-tasks`](https://github.com/bessagroup/l2co-tasks) is the task half. It provides:
- **a name registry** of ready-to-run optimizers: the optax gradient methods, the evosax distribution- and population-based algorithms, plus SHADE, TuRBO, an RBF trust region, per-evaluation-key L-BFGS and random search;
- **the `UpdateClass` container** every registry factory returns;
- **the `OptimizationStep` spec** that names an optimizer with its hyperparameters and stopping criteria;
- **ready-made Hydra optimizer configs**.

It also ships the *strategy-facing* layer meta-optimizers dispatch through: the `SubOpt` adapter, the per-optimizer handshake policy and state transfer, and menu-dispatched loss evaluation. The meta-optimization strategies themselves (`l2co`, `rl2co`, `agentic-l2co`) and the loop that runs an optimizer on a task stay in [`l2co`](https://github.com/bessagroup/l2co).

## Statement of need

Learning-to-optimize and optimizer-selection research needs many optimizers behind one calling convention, so that a selector can switch between them mid-run. `l2co-optimizers` provides that convention without the meta-learning stack:
- every optimizer is built by `optimizer_mapping(name)(model=..., loss_fn=..., pass_rng=..., opt_hash=..., bounded=..., stop_fn=...)`;
- every one steps through the same `(params, opt_state, key)` carry;
- every one reports into the same `OptHistory`.

It depends on neither `l2co` nor `l2co-tasks`, and has no notion of a task: factories take `model`, `loss_fn` and `pass_rng` as keywords. `l2co` is the bridge that unpacks an `l2co_tasks.Task` into them (l2co ADR 0018).
